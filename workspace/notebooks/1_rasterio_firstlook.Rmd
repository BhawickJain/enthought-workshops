# Reading satellite data with rasterio


## Loading a dataset

```{python}
import rasterio

# This notebook explores a single 4 band (blue, green, red, NIR) PlanetScope scene in a UTM projection.
image_file = "20190321_174348_0f1a_3B_AnalyticMS.tif"

satdat = rasterio.open(image_file)
```

```{python}
# satdat is our open dataset object
print(satdat)

# let's look at some basic information about this geoTIFF:

# dataset name
print(satdat.name)

# number of bands in this dataset
print(satdat.count)
```

## Parsing bands

```{python}
# The dataset reports a band count.
print(satdat.count)

# And provides a sequence of band indexes.  These are one indexing, not zero indexing like Numpy arrays.
print(satdat.indexes)
```

By convention the bands are indexed from 1, so its why rasterio does this from the start.


Because we know we're look at a PlanetScope 4-band analytic satellite image, we can define the bands by their order:

```{python}
# PlanetScope 4-band band order: BGRN

blue, green, red, nir = satdat.read()

# Or the slightly less efficient:
#    blue = satdat.read(1)
#    green = satdat.read(2)
#    red = satdat.read(3)
#    nir = satdat.read(4)

# Or read the entire dataset into a single 3D array:
#    data = satdat.read()
```

```{python}
# each band is stored as a numpy array, and its values are a numpy data type
print(blue.dtype)
```

```{python}
# using the blue band as an example, examine the width & height of the image (in pixels)

w = blue.shape[0]
h = blue.shape[1]

print("width: {w}, height: {h}".format(w=w, h=h))
```
