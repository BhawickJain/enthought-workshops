Supplemental Material
===============================

Jupyter Notebooks to support "Remote Sensing Programming with Python" workshop.

Requirements
--------------

This repo is optimized for use within a geospatial Jupyter environment. As such,
the following prerequisites are assumed to be installed and available at the
system level:

    - GDAL 2.3+
    - NumPy

Installation
-------------

Requires Python 3. To install Python dependencies _(for local
development, a virtualenv is strongly recommended)_:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Running Locally
----------------

For local development, it can be useful to run Jupyter from within a project virtualenv.

To set up the kernel with virtualenv packages, run the following within the
virtualenv:

    (venv) $ python -m ipykernel install --user --name <venv name>
    

After that, start Jupyter:
    
    $ jupyter notebook

From within the Notebook interface, change the kernel (`Kernel --> Change
Kernel --> <name of venv>`) to use the newly created project kernel.
