This tutorial is inspired by and steals liberally from [Benjamin Root](https://github.com/WeatherGod)'s fantastic [Anatomy of Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/AnatomyOfMatplotlib) tutorial. It also borrows some things from Rachel Rakov & Hannah Aizenman's [Introduction to Machine Learning with Sklearn](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/machine-learning). 

The authors are also grateful to Michael Grossberg for his liberal feedback and heatmap data set suggestion, Sadie Bartholomew for inspiring a coding challenge with her gorgeous [tweet](https://twitter.com/sadie_lb/status/1145385648532205568), and tutoral participant Dershan Luo for the install check bug fix. :)
